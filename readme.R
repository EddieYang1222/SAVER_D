# SAVER-D is a custom package based on SAVER
# for the analysis of transcriptional noise.

# Installing SAVER-D will replace SAVER

# To install, do the following
# > install.packages("SAVER")

# Installing official SAVER will install the SAVER-D dependencies
# Now replace SAVER with this SAVER-D

# > install.packages("./SAVER_D_package/SAVER_D_installer.tar.gz", repos=NULL)

# The SAVER objects now include additional outputs
# a, b, and k
# 1/a is the dispersion estimate with constant CV
# 1/b is the dispersion estimate with constant FF
# k is the dispersion estimate with constant Var

# End
